It all started with my eagerness to learn how WordPress sites and plugins are built. Learning becomes more and more challenging until we actually work on a technology we wanted to learn. So I decided to get my hands on WordPress.

Since I’m working full-time, I decided to spend few hours a week to learn and improve my WordPress skills. To begin with my learning journey, I started looking to work on a small WordPress project.

My exploration ended when I found an opportunity to work on a (tiny) [bug](https://github
.com/sudar/easy-retweet/issues/9) in a WordPress plugin called Easy Retweet. This plugin allows 
you to add Tweet button to your WordPress site and it was originally developed by [Sudar](http://www.sudarmuthu.com/), a prominent web and WordPress developer.

Now that I have found a project, I had to set up my development environment to work. I remembered
 using [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to set up my development environment when I played with WordPress during college days. So Xampp was my preference.

But Sudar, the plugin author, recommended to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)
 to set up the environment. Honestly that’s the first time I’m hearing about Vagrant and VVV. Through repeated trial and error, I had finally set up my development environment using Vagrant and VVV. It took me a week though, to set it all right in my Windows machine.

Now that my development environment is ready, I have to get the actual plugin code to start 
working on it. Easy Retweet plugin (repo) is hosted at GitHub and I’m a total newbie when it 
comes to Git and GitHub. Thankfully, [DevTipsShow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h9_cB9mPT8&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LFz8DZ0t-89twnelpT4Ilw) and [C0deporn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c) YouTube channels helped me to quickly get started with both.

I forked the plugin repo and started to work on the plugin. Forking is creating your own repo to work on from the original one. After a couple of hours, I was able to fix the issue. The feeling you get when your code works as expected is almost beyond words.

After my changes are complete, I had to intimate the author and request to merge my changes with 
the original repo. In the GitHub world, this is called sending a [pull request](https://help
.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). That’s how I finally ended up sending [my first pull request](http://firstpr.me/#mariadanieldeepak).

When my pull request was merged, I felt so excited and welcomed to the open source community.

I’m writing this post not to brag about how I did things, but as a reminder to myself to keep learning the web technologies as they evolve.

Now it’s time for me to hear from you. Have you sent your first pull request? If yes, then share your story and I would love to read.

Otherwise consider making your first contribution to the open source. If you need some resources 
to get started, check out [firsttimersonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/). As the name says, it is an initiative by Scott Hanselman and Kent C. Dodds for the first timers to take their baby steps towards open source.
