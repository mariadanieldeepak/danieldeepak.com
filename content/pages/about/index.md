Hi, my name is Maria Daniel Deepak and I'm hailing from the beautiful city of Salem.

I was so fascinated by the idea of building HTML web pages during my school days. By the time I finished schooling, I found my interest in building dynamic websites. By the time I graduated, I started building dynamic websites using PHP.

Today, I make a living by building applications and e-commerce websites primarily using WordPress. Though my passion remains the same, yet my perspective has completely changed - the idea of solving a business problem through a website or an application is what I enjoy the most. A solution could be anything from automating a repetitive task to whatever you can imagine.

I'm an autodidact and I learn things by [blogging](/blog) about 'em and by [contributing](/contributions) to open source WordPress projects as much as I can.

I'm a tea drinker and my hobbies include listening to podcasts, looking at the world [through a camera lens](https://www.flickr.com/photos/139894570@N02) and answering questions on Quora.

What am I doing now? See my [Now](/now) page.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) or say hello to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariaddeepak).
