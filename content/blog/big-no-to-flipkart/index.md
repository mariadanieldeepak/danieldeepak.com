My intention in this post is to not to stop you purchasing from Flipkart, rather to share my experience so you can decide for yourself.

## Upgrading To K6 Power From K4 Note

I have been using Lenovo K4 Note since its launch in Feb, 2016 and I was happy with the overall experience. I liked the responsiveness of Lenovo K4 Note and did not like the touch experience in other Android phones, in similar price range. Being a happy customer of Lenovo K4 Note, I decided to upgrade my phone when Lenovo announced the launch of Lenovo K6 Power.

## Raising Return Request After Phone Was Found Defective

Lenovo launched the K6 Power through their online retailer, Flipkart. I purchased the K6 Power from Flipkart on Feb 23, 2017. Within the first few days, I discovered that the other party with whom I was on call was not able to hear my voice. When I used a different phone this was not the case. So, I found that the phone was defective and raised a return request on Flipkart. The return process involves a technician visit to investigate the phone and then approve/deny the request based on the investigation.

## Flipkart's Way Of Saying No

While raising the return request, I specifically mentioned that the technical visit has to happen at a different address than the original purchase address. I was promised by Flipkart’s customer support team that the change in address was taken care of. Two days later, I received a call from Flipkart's technician asking for my purchase address to investigate the phone. I replied him saying the technician visit has to happen in a different address than the original purchase address and this was conveyed to Flipkart. He then asked me to check with Flipkart customer support team to get the address issue clarified.

The following day, I received an SMS from Flipkart saying that the Technician visit was cancelled without specifying the reason. This sounded rude and disgusting to me.

## Flipkart Covers Mistakes By Apologies

When I called Flipkart Customer support team to check the reason why the technician visit was cancelled, they apologized without giving me a reason. I called couple of times and found the reason updated on Flipkart by the technician was that the customer was not reachable on phone. This was painful to know because the technician spoke to me and advised to call Flipkart customer support team.

At this juncture, I was totally pissed off because I made sure that the change in address was notified to the Flipkart customer support team during my first call to Flipkart. I, again, called the support team and got my technician visit scheduled. And once again, they sent an SMS after 5 days saying that technician visit was not possible. And this time I found that it was because I fell out of the replacement window. The replacement window is 10 days from the purchase date. Each time, I called the customer support team, I had to explain the whole story and had to undergo lot of mental stress.

## Flipkart Responds Only To Social Shouts

I, then, chose to take this issue to social media and notified Flipkart via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flipkartsupport). I got a call from the Social media team asking about the problem that I faced. I had to repeat the whole story again and they scheduled the technician visit to the new address. At this juncture, I already lost the trust which I had on Flipkart. Having spent about 10,000 INR, I badly wanted to get my phone replaced.

I was waiting for the call from the technician and when the local support team called me to check my availability, I mentioned that I would be available in the morning between 9:00 and 11.30. They replied back saying they would send the technician during the specified hours. But on the specified day, no one turned up and I was frustrated. And later in the day, the same person from the Flipkart’s local support team called and asked if I would be available in the evening. I replied them saying that I would be available only in the morning and they could re-schedule the visit on the following day.

## Finally Got My Phone Fixed

Two days later, the technician arrived during the time I specified and investigated my phone. After a while, he said he had fixed my phone. I checked the phone myself and found it to be working. Though my phone perfectly works yet I completely lost the trust on Flipkart. Since then, I decided not to buy from Flipkart and I don’t recommend it to my friends, either.

More than spending money, the stress I had to undergo was huge and I have beautiful things to do in my life rather than repeatedly calling Flipkart customer support. I've, also, stopped recommending Flipkart to friends and family.
