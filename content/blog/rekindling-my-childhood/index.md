In recent times, I'm gradually seeking to rekindle my childhood dreams. When I was a kid I found joy in little things. As I grow I feel I'm getting lost in the daily grind.

As a little step towards finding joy in simple things, I started gardening.

I've added a couple more plants to my little garden but I'll save those pictures for the up-coming blog posts.
