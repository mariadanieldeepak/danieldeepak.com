I'm excited to announce that this blog is now powered by Gatsby under the hood.

I've been using WordPress to power this blog since I purchased this domain and I still use WordPress
 as part of my day job.

React entered into my arsenal since last year and I'm falling in love with it more and 
more. I decided to dive deep into React and switched to Gatsby. Gatsby is a framework based on React
 to build websites and apps.

As always, I'm looking forward to make good progress.

Today I'm grateful to my family who have strengthened me during my hardships.
