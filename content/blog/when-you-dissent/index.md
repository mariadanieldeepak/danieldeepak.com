A new month has just begun. Isn't it refreshing to start with a new beginning?

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about life. As each day pass, I care more about what I think 
about myself and worry less about what other people think about me. Do you feel the same way?

Worrying less about what other people think about you could make you feel happier. At times you 
family might make you feel bitter for differing from their views. When you differ in the eyes 
of your family remember these words, "No one will see the world just as you do".
