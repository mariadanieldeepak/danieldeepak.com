Today is my birthday. 

The fourth decade is when you get to know yourself deeper. You will understand more what you don't want in life. This phase will also teach you that the quest for finding what you want in life is never ending.

Did you know that Buddha left his wife and son to seek enlightenment by the time he was about to 
enter the fourth decade of his life. In case you're wondering I'm not gonna abandon my family in pursuit of enlightenment.

I'm excited for what's coming.
