My colleagues would always tell me that switching languages is a bad idea. They would insist that affects career growth and the pay. By the time I left Infosys, I realized that I had written production code in five different languages. Most of these on my own will and sometimes, out of project necessity. 

Having experienced the exposure to different technologies, I felt this exposure is an added advantage. The diverse experience puts you in different perspectives to understand a problem in first case, and also when you're trying to solve the problem.

Solving problems is what I enjoy the most. Technologies and languages helps you to do that in different ways.

## Why Anatta Design?

After the initial calls and the interview, I found Anatta Design to be a good match.

Anatta Design is a team of really brilliant engineers focusing on designing custom solutions to e-commerce businesses. They primarily focus on solutions using WordPress and Magento. The company follows a flat hierarchy and a no dress code culture.

Having joined Anatta, I get to choose my own set of tools to work, which I was missing in my previous companies. Going to work in your favorite Tee and trousers/shorts, completely changes the way I work and I absolutely love it. My work is focused on WordPress, PHP and MySQL. The preferred platform of choice is the Linux (Ubuntu distro to be specific) and I'm getting comfortable with it.

Each phase of our lives shapes us to the next one and I'm looking forward to this new phase of my life.
