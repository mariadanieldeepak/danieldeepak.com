I had been working in Infosys for a little over 2 years. Little did I know about the opportunity to work on WordPress, as a day job, would strike me, I felt that it was the right time to make a move. And, so I did.

## The Infosys Journey

I still remember the first day when I entered Infosys headquarters, the office where I worked. 
Infosys needs no introduction and is the [third largest IT services company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys) in India. The place was amazing with head turning buildings, abundant trees, fish ponds, huge food courts and with awesome people around. I was so proud to be part of Infosys and I still do.

Throughout my stint, I've been put in different projects and technologies and been with people who are inspiring in one way or the other. I was lucky to an extent, to pursue work on the technologies I loved.

I've made couple of friends who filled my heart with joy and I'm always grateful to those folks. I will, forever, cherish those joyous moments.

It was really a tough call, to choose to move out of Infosys, to purse my interest in developing web and WordPress applications. But I believe that I did the right thing. On my last working day, I came out with mixed feelings and long-lasting good memories.

## Wait But Why?

Infosys is a great place to work. There is no doubt about it.

Developing web applications with WordPress and PHP is something that I wanted to do, since the beginning of this year as I enjoy doing it. I've been playing around with WordPress since my college days. The way these open source communities evolve excites me and I wanted to be part of it.

Also, my perspective on life changed when I started reading books, listening to podcasts and 
started interacting with inspiring people like [Sudar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys), 
[Saurabh](http://hookrefineandtinker.com/) and [Nirav](http://niravsheth.com/). All these broadened my 
views on life.

Imagine, if you draw a box for every week of your entire life (ie. 52 boxes for a year x 90 
years), your life would fit in, on an A4 sheet. Those are your weeks and they’re all you’ve got. 
Here is a visual representation of the same shown by [WaitButWhy.com](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

I felt that I should start doing things I enjoy more, as my weekly boxes are checked off. All these made sense to me and I chose to work primarily on WordPress and PHP.
