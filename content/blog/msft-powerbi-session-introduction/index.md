Technical conferences and sessions are great opportunities to learn new technologies, tools and to meet exciting people.

Recently I had the opportunity to attend a session on Power BI for developers and professionals and I would like to share with you the stuffs that I learnt from the training.

If you're new to Power BI, then this blog post is absolutely for you. I have divided the blog post into a four part series based on the session topics.

This post is an introductory blog post and will give you a quick overview of what will be covered in each blog post.

The speaker of the session is [Kedar Ghanekar](http://www.synergetics-india.com/), Solution Specialist and Practice Head at Synergetics.

Okay, let's get started.

The one-day session was broken into four small sessions. The following are the broad classification of the one-day training session.

1. Introduction to Power BI
1. Power BI Data Sources
1. Po1. wer BI Reports and Dashboards
1. Power BI Live Reporting

## Introduction to Power BI

This blog post will focus on introducing Power BI and its capabilities.

The speaker started by introducing Power BI and the tools included in the suite. He then explained the history of Power BI, how to get started with Power BI and the infrastructure needed to use Power BI.

Later in the session, the speaker covered the pricing model of Power BI and whom Power BI is intended for.

## Power BI Data Sources

We cannot speak of analysis and visualization without connecting to data. This blog post focuses on Power BI’s ability to connect to variety of data sources.

The speaker focused on the variety of data sources such as files, databases and cloud apps that can be connected to Power BI to acquire data for analysis.

The speaker also focused on Content Packs in Power BI in this session. Content packs allows to share reports and insights with intended people or groups.

Pushing data to Power BI via Personal Gateways was also discussed.

## Power BI Reports and Dashboards

This blog post enlightens on how you can generate reports and visualizations after connecting to data.

The speaker began by highlighting the three important components of Power BI – Datasets, Reports and Dashboards. The hierarchy between these components were also explained.

The speaker then continued the session with a simple demonstration. A sample report was generated and then the speaker demonstrated how the reports can be enhanced by adding parameters, filters, etc. Adding parameters and filters gives more flexibility to the end users in understanding the data.

The demonstration also included saving the reports and the speaker explained the various file formats used in Power BI.

## Power BI Real-Time Reporting

This session focused on creating real-time dashboards and reports using Power BI. This allows to create visualizations with data continually updated.

REST API in Power BI allows to fetch and push data to Power BI from client/web applications. This is very useful when creating real-time reports. The speaker gave an overview on how REST API in Power BI works and demonstrated with a small console application.

The speaker also mentioned how Azure stream analytics can be used with Power BI for real-time reporting.

With this the session came to an end and the speaker opened up for questions.

The session was engaging and I felt that it session proved to be effective and the speaker attained the purpose of the session — introducing Power BI to Business Intelligence developers and Professionals.

Thanks to my Organization, Synergetics and Microsoft for organizing such an informative and effective session.
