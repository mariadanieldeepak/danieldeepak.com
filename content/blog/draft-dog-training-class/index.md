If you believe educating your children is important then you already have an answer to why 
educating your dog is important. Nurturing your dog will allow you to be in harmony with the dog.

Imagine your dog patiently lying in bed until you finish your meal. Imagine your dog walking by 
your side when you take for a walk. Imagine your dog doing their business outside and not soiling
 your house. Do you see how you can benefit from a dog training class already?

Here are three reasons for you to find a dog training class.

## Communication

Dogs don't speak our language. How do you make them understand your expectations with language as
 a barrier? You can't.
 
This is where science comes into picture. The results of researches conducted on animal learning 
helps us to teach them desired behaviours. This is why training is one part of the equation and 
finding a dog training class that is backed by science is the other part of the equation.

## Company

Would you be willing to team up with a college, whom you don't trust, to complete a project
 at your workplace? Dogs are no different.

In order for the dog to listen to you, you two must become a team. Becoming partners doesn't 
happen overnight and you have to earn their trust.

A good dog training class will help you bond with your dog and help you earn your dog's trust. 

## Confidence
