Almost a decade ago, I graduated from college. Right after the graduation the era of 
struggles began. Every Indian could relate to this.

Since then the craze for Birthdays gradually faded. They never seemed important until I talked to
 a five year old during my morning walk today. She started listing birthdays of her family 
 members month wise. I was taken aback for a second and realized that I was missing the small 
 pleasures in life.
 
While the entire nation is worried on the outburst of COVID-19, all that bothers a five year old 
is that she couldn't celebrate the birthdays of her family members with cakes.

The little girl inscribed that Birthdays are important.
