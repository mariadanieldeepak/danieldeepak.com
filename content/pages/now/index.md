This [Now](http://nownownow.com/about) page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now3).

I’m in Salem, India, trying to lead a peaceful and habit-based life. In addition to my full-time 
job with [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/), I spend all of my free time on the following:

- Spending time with my family
- Training my beautiful dogs
- Creating videos for my YouTube channel
- Writing contents for this [blog](/)
- Trying to sleep more (7 hours or more)
﻿
These are my priorities right now. I’ll update this page as and when my activities or priorities 
change. This page was last updated on Apr 28, 2020.
